<h1>FingerPrint Matching scanner</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
Fingerprint Matching is a project using the Sokoto Coventry Fingerprint dataset. This project integrates sophisticated image processing techniques and modern machine-learning algorithms to ensure reliable and efficient fingerprint matching. The inspiration for this project was basically from the shows "Criminal Minds" and "Law and Order" which are crime shows that were introduced to me. The Fingerprint scanner project was made because I wanted to demonstrate how machine language is used in all fields. Fingerprint matching is used in the 21st century to solve crimes because everyone has a unique fingerprint this project demonstrates how fingerprint matching was created
